The Bloodborne Save Manager is designed to help players efficiently manage their save files for Bloodborne. It provides an easy-to-use interface for backing up, restoring, and organising multiple game saves, allowing users to:

    - Switch between different progress states.
    - Practise specific areas and bosses.
    - Retry sections of the game effortlessly.

=== Features ===
Profile-Based Save Management
    - Players can create separate profiles, each containing different sets of save files.
    - Profiles help in organising multiple playthroughs, character builds, or progression states.

Savestate Backup and Loading
    - Users can create savestates (snapshots of their current save files) within a selected profile.
    - At any time, a savestate can be loaded back into the game, restoring progress to a previous point.
    - Savestates are stored as complete copies of the save directory, ensuring no data loss.

Launching the BB Launcher
    - Users can launch the BB_Launcher at any time from this program.

=== How It Works ===
Setup Save, Profile, and Launcher Directories
    1. To run the program, run BloodborneSaveManager.exe inside of the BloodborneSaveManager folder.
    2. On first launch, select:
           - The gameâ€™s save directory (typically user/savedata within your ShadPS4 folder).
           - A profile directory (any folder of your choice).
           - The BB_Launcher directory (wherever you have BB_Launcher installed).

Creating and Managing Profiles
    1. Click "Create Profile" to make a new profile folder.
    2. Each profile acts as a container for different game save backups, useful for creating categories or groups of savestates.

    2. Quit out to the title screen at the desired location for your save.
    3. Select a profile and click "Create Savestate" to make a snapshot of your current save for that profile.
    4. Once you have selected the desired savestate in your profile, click "Load Savestate" to load the selected save, then press 'Continue' on the title screen.

    At any time, click "Delete Savestate" to remove an unwanted save.
    At any time, click "Rename Savestate" to rename the currently selected save.

Exporting Profiles
    1. Select the profile you would like to export.
    2. Click "Export Profile"
    3. Select a directory to save the .zip of your profile in.
    4. The .zip of the profile is now ready to be sent to others!

    2. Find and select the .zip archive of your desired profile.
